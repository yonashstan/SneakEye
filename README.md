MOBILE APP FOR SNEAKER MODEL RECOGNITION 


This project demonstrates a solution for developing a mobile application for the iOS platform that can identify a sneaker model from an image. The user will be able to upload images with unknown sneaker models and get their name and additional information about them. The app also has a wishlist where the user can save favourite sneakers.

To create this application, I used technologies such as machine learning with CoreML, CoreData, JSON, and SwiftUI.


1. Opening and providing the image for the application.
